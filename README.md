# st - simple terminal
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

## Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

## Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):
```
make clean install
```

## Running st
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:
```
tic -sx st.info
```

See the man page for additional details.
